# TicTacToe

Mini-Assignment 2: You are asked to create a TicTacToe Game using JS ES6 as well.

- The website should display a grid (a div background). On click on each case on this board, a coin will appear (faded in) based on the player.
- You have two players (red and yellow).
- Respect all cases and make sure you add a scoring system.
- Deadline: Tonight (September 16th), at 11:59 PM.
- You have 11:59 hours left :rocket:
